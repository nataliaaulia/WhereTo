# WhereTo
"Where to?" is an Android application, which was created to promote civic engagement.
"Where to?" is dedicated to help non-profit organizations post their volunteer and donation opportunities 
and also for people to find volunteer and donation opportunities in their areas easier.

This code is only for the "volunteer" side and the code for the "organization" side will be created soon.
