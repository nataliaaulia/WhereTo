# WhereTo
"Where to?" is an Android application, which was created to promote civic engagement.
"Where to?" is dedicated to help non-profit organizations post their volunteer and donation opportunities and also for
people who are interested in volunteering and donating to these organizations to interact easier.

This code is only for the "volunteer" side and the code for the "organization" side will be created soon.
